The cipher looks like ROT-13, or similar. Using http://www.rot13.com/ to test
some variation we find that ROT-9 gives us a plain english output:

> The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically 
> furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor 
> pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids 
> and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their 
> ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different 
> associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. The flag
> is the phrase with dashes: flag what is a domestic cat.

Flag : `flag-what-is-a-domestic-cat`
