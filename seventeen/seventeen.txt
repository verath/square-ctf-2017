** CONFIDENTIAL: Please do not talk about seventeen with non-Evil Robot Corp. employees **

Seventeen is a very simple programming language. It gets its name from the fact
that there are only 17 instructions.

Seventeen is used for internal cryptography applications. The seventeen core runtime
has been proven to be secure (see seventeen.coq). In the future, we plan to expand
this language and build commercial products, so please keep all this confidential.

Here are some of the core concepts:

* Each program starts execution with the first instruction in the file, and keeps
  processing instructions sequentially unless an IFZ, IFG, CALL, JMP or EXIT
  instruction is encountered.

* There are three storage systems:
  - a stack (where data can be pushed)
  - a vector (where data can be read or written using an offset)
  - variables

  The state of all these storage systems is undefined when a program starts.

* Most operations work with the stack. E.g. "1 2 ADD" will:
  - push 1 on the stack
  - push 2 on the stack
  - Replace these two numbers with their sum

  The resulting stack will contain 3.

* Variables and labels are in the "a-z_" range ('a' to 'z' with '_').

Make sure to read the formal specification (see seventeen.spec)
