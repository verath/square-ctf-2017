# Needle in the haystack (500 points, Forensics)

We are given some file we don't really know what it is. Fortunately, binwalk can help us out:

```
$ binwalk needle-in-the-haystack

Since binwalk doesn't seem to have any problems recognizing the file, let's have 
it extract the contents of it too:

```
$ binwalk -eMr needle-in-the-haystack
```

Looking at the extracted files, we see that what we are looking at is a blog application written in
ruby on rails. But perhaps more interesting is the fact that there is also a `.git` directory, meaning
we probably have a whole git history for the application.

```
_needle-in-the-haystack.extracted/_7000.extracted$ ls -a
.  ..  blog  .git
```

The git index seems to be intact, and we can check the log. Nothing too interesting in the commit
messages though, and nothing seem to mention a 'flag-':

```
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean

$ git log --oneline

$ git log -S"flag-"
```


The most recent commit looks pretty interesting though. A `git show -p 70659e6` shows us that the commit
adds the following line to two of the files:

```rb
http_basic_authenticate_with name: "shh", password: "flap-12b36a752f93870393d8311b4e1529c1", except: [:index, :show]
```

It almost looks like a flag! By submitting it we are taken to a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ),
making it pretty clear that this was not in fact the final solution...

So far we have only looked at the `master` branch, but there are actually multiple other ones. 
However, we quickly find that they are all merged to master already:

```
$ git branch
  comments
  deleting
* master
  refactoring
  security
$ git branch --no-merged master
```

What about deleted branched? A quick google for how to recover branches points us
towards the `git reflog` command, which seem to make it possible to list commits that
are no longer part of the "normal" log. The `reflog` command takes the same parameters
as the `log` command, so we can again use the `-S` flag to search for the
`flag-` string we are looking for. And this time we actually find the flag:


```
$ git reflog -S"flag-"
68490b1 HEAD@{51}: cherry-pick: fast-forward
68490b1 HEAD@{53}: commit: Basic article add

$ git show 68490b1 -p | grep -C 2 'flag-'

flag: `flag-a89a24c836bde785292b908a25b9241d`
